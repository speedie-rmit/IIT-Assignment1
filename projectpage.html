      <h1>Project Idea</h1>
      <div class="projecttext">
<h2>Overview:</h2>
<h4>The project I have chosen is a virtual reality (VR) survival shooter, which will include a custom controller for the player to plug their VR controller into in order to play with. The controller would be 3D printed with a small motherboard inside that would allow connection to not only the controller but the computer as well in order to function. The game would be based on a small child's nightmare in a doll house, with life size dolls coming in waves to get the main character. The custom controller itself would be in the shape of a toy dart gun that would also be visualised in the game.
</h4>

<h2>Motivation:</h2>
<h4>The main motivation behind this project idea is the lack of survival shooters for those with VR. Most shooter games are either competitive against other people in nature or campaign driven, whereas this VR game will be more of an endless style survival shooter aimed at a younger audience. Another motivation is the lack of VR games with their own custom controller. You have companies such as Zero Latency that allow you to come in and use their controller but it isn't something you can play from your own home. The controller itself would be light enough for easy access to a younger audience as well.
</h4>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<pre><h4>You awake one night to find that you are no longer in your bed, but in the doll house that has sat untouched for months in your living room.
In your hands you find your favourite dart gun and in the other a flashlight, in the distance a giggle, frozen in place with fear you must survive as long as possible.

The game:
    This game places you in the position of a child stuck in a repetitive nightmare, with waves of dolls coming to get you.
    The game itself plays as an endless shooter, scoring you points and game currency as you fight your way through the endless stream of enemies.

Player: Stuck in the one place/small area to move around in, able to turn 360 degrees. Flash light in one hand and dart gun in the other.
            Health bar that takes damage from the dolls when they get too close.

Flashlight: Helps slightly increase visibility in what is a pretty dark environment. But will have to balance keeping it charged as if it is used for too long
                  power will run out. Upgrades available from the shop

Dart Gun: Endless ammo but starting dart gun will have a sluggish fire rate with upgrades available.

Dolls: 3 different enemies each with their own unique ‘traits’. Betty moves at a regular speed but will take average damage before defeated.
          Sally is faster but takes less damage to be defeated. Dawn is more of a boss, bigger and will charge towards the player if they are not looking,
          but will slow down when the player is looking at them. A large amount of damage will need to be inflicted before being defeated, has a distinctive
          laugh to let the player know when she has come to play. Each doll will award the player points for unlocks and currency to buy new items.

Shop: Option in the main menu can buy upgrades for guns and flashlights; these function as a one off purchase so players are able to switch between
          different weapons. Other objects you can buy include health potions and traps for enemies; these function as a buy a number of items to use.

The Custom Controller:
A 3D printed dart gun will be designed for use as a controller which will be partnered along with the game's release. It will contain a holder for the VR controller,
different versions would then need to be made for the different available controllers. Will contain a trigger button that when pressed sends a signal to a small
circuit board in the controller to fire off the gun in game. The Controller would come with the option of connecting via Bluetooth to the player's computer if the
computer had available software or an extra dongle would be included for connection. Tracking the location of the dart gun would come from the VR controller
and set up for where the controller sits in a player's hand. Controller would come with its own charger as well as a battery pack equipped for the VR controller
to plug into and use the power from the gun itself to save the player having multiple batteries to worry about when playing through the game.

<h2>   Tools and Technology:</h2>
<h4>        Game:
            - Unity - create game in
            - 3D modelling software eg Maya or Blender - Create art assets, both for game and printed dart gun
            - Photo editor or drawing application eg Photoshop - Create textures and concept art
            - 3D printer - To print dart gun
          Controller:
            - Circuit board eg arduino nano
            - Mechanical switch
            - Battery pack with charging plug.
            - Wires for connection purposes
            - Weights for balancing weight of dart gun.
</h4></pre>

<h2>Skills Required:</h2>
<h4>A programmer who is able to code in C# will be required to create the mechanics of the game, A 3D artist will be required to create 3D assets both for the game and in regards to creating the 3D model that will be printed to be the controller. A Game designer will be required to make the level lay out and help test and balance game play.
For the controller as mentioned there will be the requirement for the 3D artist to design the controller as well as someone who is able to wire up a circuit board and get the trigger on the gun to work as a switch to get input for the controller and help map it as input for the game.
</h4>

<pre>
      <h2>Outcome:</h2>
            <h4>With a successful project this will be one of the first VR shooters as well as VR games, commercially released, to have its own custom controller.
The impact could start a new way for gaming as well as accessibility for people to play VR video games. Although the VR controller can be quite
simple to some there are still quite a lot of buttons this would just deduce the buttons on the controller to just 1 button, a trigger button.
Although the use of the in game flash light would still require the use on the normal controller again there would be a reduction of buttons used,
such as just a trigger button that when held down activates the flashlight and another button to activate the menu.
