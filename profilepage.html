Prospecting personality traits. They tend to have open minds, approaching life,
new experiences, and people with grounded warmth. Their ability to stay in the
moment helps them uncover exciting potentials."

well above other scores, are defined as multimodal.
They are of two types. There are those who are flexible in their
communication preferences and who switch from mode to mode
depending on what they are working with. They are context specific.
They choose a single mode to suit the occasion or situation."

drive required to achieve successful outcomes. You are confident in your ability
to overcome hurdles and difficulties along the path to accomplishing your goals in
the workplace. A high score in this trait indicates to employers that you are highly
employable and are likely to be successful in your role."
(Institute of Psychometric Coaching site by gee, n.d.)</h5>



<h6>Achievement Driven</h6><h5>"Your result indicates that you are likely to have a strong inner drive to achieve excellence in what you do.
You have an ambition to be successful, and often have a strong sense of direction career-wise and in life.
You are likely to be willing to stay later than others or invest more effort than others to accomplish tasks to
the best of your capabilities. A high score on this trait is highly desirable by employers.
Please bear in mind that an extremely high drive for achievement is usually associated with being a workaholic."

        <h2>Reflection:</h2>
        <h4>
For me these test results give me an idea of how I process information and emotions. It has outlined strengths and weaknesses of mine that I was not aware of beforehand, although now that I have reflected, I can identify and relate to a lot of what has been said about me by each of these tests.
Knowing these weaknesses means I can work on them to better myself. I may not be able to change my weaknesses but I can work on how I react to them. One of the major weaknesses I relate to is the Easily Stressed - "Adventurers live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, people with this personality type (especially Turbulent ones) can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favour of gnashing teeth".
I know for me personally this is very accurate but I had never thought about it being a personality trait, with being able to identify this I can become more objective and keep an eye out for my overstressed triggers in order to not react negatively.
</h4><h4>
As an adventurer I "seek out positions that give me as much wiggle room as possible" that way I am able to do things my own way.
Being an Adventurer means that I "Don't like to be controlled" and that I "loathe being micromanaged." Being able to identify that these are not my preferred way to work will help in a group project scenario as I will be able to be upfront with the group to let them know that is not how I am able to work, but also if there is a team member who is trying to micromanage I can deal with it more effectively by talking to them rather than just avoiding the work like I have done in the past.
</h4><h4>
This information is really important for working in a team because I can pitch myself as someone who prefers to work in a cooperative rather than a dictatorship. By looking at other team members' personality results I can get a small insight to how they might operate and work in a team and see if those traits would work well with mine. I also understand that some traits may be different and not fully match up so speaking with people to form a team will definitely come more into play rather than solely relying on the personality test results.
