  <h2>Personal Information</h2>
  <p>  Name: Jayde Speedie </p>
  <p>  Preferred name: Speedie </p>
  <p>  Pronouns: She/Her </p>
  <p>  RMIT Student Number: S3525668 </p>
  <p>  Email: speedie.devs@gmail.com </p>
  <p>  About me: </p>
  <p> I am a caucasian female from Melbourne Victoria and I am at least 4th generation Australian. I completed Year 12 (VCE) in 2015 and then went onto study an Advanced Diploma of Profession Games Development (Design Stream) graduating in 2017. I have then been working for the last 2 and a half years while I find where I want to take my life and career. My main language is English and is the only one I can fluently speak, I also know a little French and Japanese, I am also currently learning Mandarin. I am an Indie game developer working in a small team to create a mobile puzzle game.  </p>

  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
  <p>  My passion for IT has originated from playing video games, It first started from modding games such as minecraft and building my own systems and then moved to making my own games in game maker. Although IT wasn’t my original career plan I enjoyed it as a hobby.It wasn't until I was finishing year 12 that I realised that information technology was something that I wanted to pursue a little more, it wasn't until the start of this year that I decided that I wanted to pursue it as a career.
I have chosen to study at RMIT because of the intro units to information technology and programming, as well as being one of the bigger universities and being able to enrol in just a few units before I commit to the full degree. I have no expectations for my studies other than to learn new skills and build upon the skills I already have from my game development experience.
 </p>
  <h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<p> http://www.ictcareer.com.au/jobs/7180-australian-federal-police/57604</p>
<p>Job Title: Technical Analyst, Cybercrime Operations</p>
<p>The role is to work with the Cyber Crime Operations teams to help solve and protect Australians from Cybercrimes. This is the kind of role I am aiming for as I have a passion for technology and helping to keep others safe. I want to be able to use my skills to help others . My career goal is to work in the Cyber Crime Operations team in the Australian Federal Police.
Skills required for the role:</p>
<p> - Search warrant knowledge</p>
<p> - Use open sources Intelligence and analyse gathered data</p>
<p> - Java, Python and C programming languages</p>
<p> - Analysing Log files, Network data captures, malware identifying</p>
<p> - Mentoring skills</p>

Due to this being my first step in working towards this role I have limited skills in relation to this career, the skills I do have are in relation to the C programming Language as I currently know a little C#.
My plan for developing my skills is first working my way through this course with a few of the intro units, this will help to develop my Java programming skills. I will then move to do a course more specified in cyber security and criminology ready for an entry level role in the federal police, moving my way up as I learn more specific skills, such as how to execute a search warrant as well as other cyber security tasks specific to the federal police.

<h4>What do these test results mean for you?</h4>
<p>For me these test results give me an idea of how I process information and emotions. It has outlined strengths and weaknesses of mine that I was not aware of beforehand, although now that I have reflected I can definitely identify and relate to a lot of what has been specifically said about each of the tests..   </p>
<p> Knowing these weaknesses means I can work on them to better myself. I may not be able to change my weaknesses but I can work on how I react to them. One of the major weaknesses I relate to is the Easily Stressed - "Adventurers live in the present, full of emotion. When situations get out of control, people with this personality type (especially Turbulent ones) can shut down, losing their characteristic charm and creativity in favour of gnashing teeth".  </p>
<p> I know for me personally this is very accurate but I had never thought about it being a personality trait, with being able to identify this I can become more objective and keep an eye out for my overstressed triggers in order to not react negatively.  </p>
<h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>
<p> As an adventurer I "seek out positions that give me as much wiggle room as possible" that way I am able to do things my own way.  </p>
<p>Being an Adventurer means that I "Don't like to be controlled" and that I "loathe being micromanaged." Being able to identify that these are not my preferred way to work will help in a group project scenario as I will be able to be upfront with the group to let them know that is not how I am able to work, but also if there is a team member who is trying to micromanage I can deal with it more effectively by talking to them rather than just avoiding the work like I have done in the past.   </p>
<h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>
<p> This information is really important for working in a team because I can pitch myself as someone who prefers to work in a cooperative rather than a dictatorship. By looking at other team members' personality results I can get a small insight to how they might operate and work in a team and see if those traits would work well with mine. I also understand that some traits may be different and not fully match up so speaking with people to form a team will definitely come more into play rather than solely relying on the personality test results.  </p>
  <h2>Project Idea</h2>
  <h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The project I have chosen is a virtual reality (VR) survival shooter, which will include a custom controller for the player to plug their VR controller into in order to play with. The controller would be 3D printed with a small motherboard inside that would allow connection to not only the controller but the computer as well in order to function. The game would be based on a small child's nightmare in a doll house, with life size dolls coming in waves to get the main character. The custom controller itself would be in the shape of a toy dart gun that would also be visualised in the game.   </p>
<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p> The main motivation behind this project idea is the lack of survival shooters for those with VR. Most shooter games are either competitive against other people in nature or campaign driven, whereas this VR game will be more of an endless style survival shooter aimed at a younger audience. Another motivation is the lack of VR games with their own custom controller. You have companies such as Zero Latency that allow you to come in and use their controller but it isn't something you can play from your own home. The controller itself would be light enough for easy access to a younger audience as well.  </p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p> You awake one night to find that you are no longer in your bed, but in the doll house that has sat untouched for months in your living room. In your hands you find your favourite dart gun and in the other a flashlight, in the distance a giggle, frozen in place with fear you must survive as long as possible.  </p>
<h5>The game</h5>
<p>This game places you in the position of a child stuck in a repetitive nightmare, with waves of dolls coming to get you. The game itself plays as an endless shooter, scoring you points and game currency as you fight your way through the endless stream of enemies.   </p>
<p>Player: Stuck in the one place/small area to move around in, able to turn 360 degrees. Flash light in one hand and dart gun in the other. Health bar that takes damage from the dolls when they get too close.   </p>
<p> Flashlight: Helps slightly increase visibility in what is a pretty dark environment. But will have to balance keeping it charged as if it is used for too long power will run out. Upgrades available from the shop  </p>
<p> Dart Gun: Endless ammo but starting dart gun will have a sluggish fire rate with upgrades available.  </p>
<p> Dolls: 3 different enemies each with their own unique ‘traits’. Betty moves at a regular speed but will take average damage before defeated. Sally is faster but takes less damage to be defeated. Dawn is more of a boss, bigger and will charge towards the player if they are not looking, but will slow down when the player is looking at them. A large amount of damage will need to be inflicted before being defeated, has a distinctive laugh to let the player know when she has come to play. Each doll will award the player points for unlocks and currency to buy new items.  </p>
<p> Shop: Option in the main menu can buy upgrades for guns and flashlights; these function as a one off purchase so players are able to switch between different weapons.. Other objects you can buy include health potions and traps for enemies; these function as a buy a number of items to use.  </p>
<h5>The Custom Controller</h5>
<p> A 3D printed dart gun will be designed for use as a controller which will be partnered along with the game's release. It will contain a holder for the VR controller, different versions would then need to be made for the different available controllers. Will contain a trigger button that when pressed sends a signal to a small circuit board in the controller to fire off the gun in game. The Controller would come with the option of connecting via Bluetooth to the player's computer if the computer had available software or an extra dongle would be included for connection. Tracking the location of the dart gun would come from the VR controller and set up for where the controller sits in a player's hand. Controller would come with its own charger as well as a battery pack equipped for the VR controller to plug into and use the power from the gun itself to save the player having multiple batteries to worry about when playing through the game.  </p>

<h4>Tools and Technology</h4>
<h5>Game</h5>
<p> Unity - create game in </p>
<p>3D modelling software eg Maya or Blender - Create art assets, both for game and printed dart gun   </p>
<p>Photo editor or drawing application eg Photoshop - Create textures and concept art</p>
<h5>Controller</h5>
<p> 3D printer - To print dart gun  </p>
<p> Circuit board eg arduino nano  </p>
<p>Mechanical switch   </p>
<p>Battery pack with charging plug.   </p>
<p> Wires for connection purposes  </p>
<p>Weights for balancing weight of dart gun.</p>

<h4>Skills Required</h4>
<p>  A programmer who is able to code in C# will be required to create the mechanics of the game, A 3D artist will be required to create 3D assets both for the game and in regards to creating the 3D model that will be printed to be the controller. A Game designer will be required to make the level lay out and help test and balance game play.
For the controller as mentioned there will be the requirement for the 3D artist to design the controller as well as someone who is able to wire up a circuit board and get the trigger on the gun to work as a switch to get input for the controller and help map it as input for the game. </p>

<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p> With a successful project this will be one of the first VR shooters as well as VR games to have its own custom controller. The impact could start a new way for gaming as well as accessibility for people to play VR video games. Although the VR controller can be quite simple to some there are still quite a lot of buttons this would just deduce the buttons on the controller to just 1 button, a trigger button. Although the use of the in game flash light would still require the use on the normal controller again there would be a reduction of buttons used, such as just a trigger button that when held down activates the flashlight and another button to activate the menu.  </p>
