          <h2>Interest In IT</h2>
          <h4>  My passion for IT has originated from playing video games, It first started from modding games such as Minecraft, building my own systems and then moving to making my own games on Game Maker. Although IT wasnâ€™t my original career plan I enjoyed it as a hobby. It wasn't until I was finishing year 12 that I realised that information technology was something that I wanted to pursue a little more, it wasn't until the start of this year that I decided that I wanted to pursue it as a career. </h4>
          <h4>  I have chosen to study at RMIT because of the intro units to information technology and programming, as well as being one of the bigger universities and being able to enrol in just a few units before I commit to the full degree. I have no expectations for my studies other than to learn new skills and build upon the skills I already have from my game development experience. </h4>
